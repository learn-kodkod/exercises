excersise that cmmand are not presssent in presentation:



Starting Point
 Avraham opens the command line and wants to check which directory he is currently in.

c:\Users>cd


Exploring the Environment
 Now that Alex knows where he is, he wants to see which files and folders exist in the current directory.

c:\Users>dir


Navigating to the Users Folder
 Avraham decides to move to the C:\Users directory to access his personal files.

c:\Users>cd DELL


Creating a New Project Folder
 Inside his user directory, Avraham wants to start a new project, so he creates a folder named MyFolder.

c:\Users\DELL>mkdir MyFolder

need to add explanation of > >>

Starting a Document
 Inside MyFolder, Avraham starts a new document to write down the project plan and writes “Hello” in it.

echo "Hello" > MyFile.txt


Adding More Notes
 He remembers some more ideas and adds the word “World” to the same file.

echo "World" >> MyFile.txt



Renaming for Clarity
 The file name looks too generic to him, so he decides to change it to something clearer.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>ren MyFile.txt MynewFile.txt




Creating a Backup
 To avoid losing data, Avraham creates a copy of the file with the new name.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>copy MynewFile.txt MycopyFile.txt
        1 file(s) copied.



File Organization
 He moves the backup file to a dedicated folder where all backups are stored.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>move MycopyFile.txt "c:\Users\DELL\MyBackup"
        1 file(s) moved.


Deleting Unnecessary Files
 After realizing that the original file is no longer needed, he deletes it.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>del MynewFile.txt


Advanced
Checking Network Connection
 Before uploading the project, Avraham checks his IP address settings.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>ipconfig



Identity Verification
 For documentation purposes, Avraham verifies which user is currently logged into the system to make sure he is working under the correct account.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>whoami

Checking System Performance
 He notices the computer is running slower than usual, so he decides to check which processes are running in the background and may be consuming too many resources.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>tasklist

Closing Unnecessary Applications
 Avraham identifies that Notepad is open without being used and decides to close it to free up resources.

c:\Users\DELL\MyFolder>taskkill /IM notepad.exe



Reopening for Editing
 Later, he remembers he still has more to edit in the document and reopens Notepad to add a few lines.

c:\Users\DELL\MyBackup>notepad MycopyFile.txt
